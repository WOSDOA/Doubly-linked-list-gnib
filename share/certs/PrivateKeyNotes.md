Code-signing private key notes
==

The private keys for these certificates were generated on Gavin's main work machine,
following the certificate authoritys' recommendations for generating certificate
signing requests.

For OSX, the private key was generated by Keychain.app on Gavin's main work machine.
The key and certificate is in a separate, passphrase-protected keychain file that is
unlocked to sign the Bitcoin-Qt.app bundle.

For Windows, the private key was generated by Firefox running on Gavin's main work machine.
The key and certificate were exported into a separate, passphrase-protected PKCS#12 file, and
then deleted from Firefox's keystore. The exported file is used to sign the Windows setup.exe.

Threat analysis
--

Gavin is a single point of failure. He could be coerced to divulge the secret signing keys,
allowing somebody to distribute a Bitcoin-Qt.app or bitcoin-qt-setup.exe with a valid
signature but containing a malicious binary.

Or the machine Gavin uses to sign the binaries could be compromis
